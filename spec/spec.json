A distance of 0.0 means that the vertex is on the plane, a positive distance means that the vertex is insider the clip plane, and a negative distance means that the point is outside the clip plane. The clip distances will be linearly interpolated across the primitive and the portion of the primitive with interpolated distances less than 0.0 will be clipped.",

The array must be sized to include all clip planes that are enabled via the OpenGL API; if the size does not include all enabled planes, results are undefined. The size may be at most gl_MaxClipDistances. The number of varying components consumed by gl_ClipDistance will match the size of the array, no matter how many planes are enabled. The shader must also set all values in gl_ClipDistance that have been enabled via the OpenGL API, or results are undefined.

It may be written at any time during shader execution. The value written to gl_ClipDistance will be used by primitive assembly, clipping, culling and other fixed functionality operations, if present, that operate on primitives after vertex processing has occurred.",
                "In the tessellation control language, the gl_PerVertex named block is used to construct an array, gl_out[], whose gl_ClipDistance members hold clip distances for each of the control points, which become available as inputs to the subsequent tessellation evaluation shader.",

It is also undefined after the geometry processing stage if the geometry shader executable calls EmitVertex without having written gl_ClipDistance since the last call to EmitVertex (or hasn't written it at all).",

                "In the geometry language, gl_ViewportIndex is used to specify the index of the viewport to which the next primitive emitted from the shader should be drawn. Primitives generated by the geometry shader will undergo viewport transformation and scissor testing using the viewport transformation and scissor rectangle selected by the value of gl_ViewportIndex. The viewport index used will come from one of the vertices in the primitive being shaded. However, which vertex the viewport index comes from is implementation-defined, and so it is recommended to use the same viewport index for all vertices of a primitive. If a geometry shader does not assign a value to gl_ViewportIndex, viewport transform and scissor rectangle zero will be used. If a geometry shader statically assigns a value to gl_ViewportIndex and there is a path through the shader that does not assign a value to gl_ViewportIndex, the value of gl_ViewportIndex is undefined for executions of the shader that take that path.",
                "In the fragment language, gl_ViewportIndex will have the same value that was written to the output variable gl_ViewportIndex in the geometry stage. If the geometry stage does not dynamically assign to gl_ViewportIndex, the value of gl_ViewportIndex in the fragment shader will be undefined. If the geometry stage makes no static assignment to gl_ViewportIndex, the fragment stage will read zero. Otherwise, the fragment stage will read the same value written by the geometry stage, even if that value is out of range. If a fragment shader contains a static access to gl_ViewportIndex, it will count against the implementation defined limit for the maximum number of inputs to the fragment stage."
